# Important Notes
* This is made in **Discord.JS V13** and if you want to use this in V12 then you would have to do changes.
* Recommended NodeJS V16+.
* If you want to change the `ready` event then remember that the `class Handler` exports arrays of the loaded events , commands and aliases count. To get the correct value then do like this.
```js
const info = require(Path to class file)
info.loadedCmds[info.loadedCmds.length - 1]
info.loadedEvents[info.loadedEvents.length - 1]
info.loadedAliases[info.loadedAliases.length - 1]
```
